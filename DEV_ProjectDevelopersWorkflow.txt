PROJECT DEVELOPERS WORKFLOW:

// NOTE: I use this application to manage the development of this application. All these feature requests will be
entered in the feature request table.


1. Create a feature request and place it in FeatureRequests FeatureRequests.txt. I will transfer it in my database.
Eventually other developers will be able to connect to the database over the internet and place feature requests.

2. Implement the changes locally and merge them to the NewFeatures branch on GitHub.
I will look at the changes and merge them to my local master if approved. I often merge my local master to GitHub so you can get the latest version.


3. Read the CodePractices.txt for common code practices. You can suggest other code practices for consideration.

4. Each developer will be approved to work on specific feature of the applications so merging will be much easier.
Modify the changelog.txt and I will upload to the change log table.
