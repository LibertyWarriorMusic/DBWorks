FEATURE:00002 Direct Linking: DATE_LOGGED:10 March 2020 DATA_IMPLEMENTED: Implemented
We need to creating table linking features. There will be two types of link, simple direct linking and a lookup table linking.
This request implements the simple direct linking.
Simple direct linking is when you create a FLAG called LOOKUP_SELECTION{TableName;ColumnNumber;}. This will load a combobox with entries from another table.
For example, you might have a people table that you want to use as a field lookup in another table. You simply write down the table name and the field column number so the application
knows where to extract the data from.
