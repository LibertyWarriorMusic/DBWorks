COMMON CODE PRACTICES

This document will define code practices for this project that need to be adopted before new code can be approved. This is an active document that will be changed over time as new code practices get developed.


1. All functions need to have a description in the cpp files.

2. All class variable members need to have m_ at the begining of the varible.

Example
m_bFlag for bool
m_sMyString for strings
m_iMyNumber for int
m_lMynumber for long
m_txtCtl for any class pointer you only need m_

3. If you want to use the global setting structure in your code, include the global.h header at the top of your cpp file.

Example
Settings.sDatabase
Settings.sUser


4. Utility.cpp is provided for all static utility functions.
Examples
    //DATABASE UTILITIES
    static wxString GetTableNameFromDBWorksTables(long lTableId); // Loads an array with all values from a table given TableId and ColumnNumber
    static wxString GetTableFieldNameFromTable(wxString sTableName, long lColumnNumber); //Get a table fieldname given the TableName and ColumnNumber
    static void LoadStringArrayFromDatabaseTable(wxArrayString &sArray, long lTableId, long lColumnNumber);// Load an StringArray with from a table given the tableId and Column number
