BUG:00001 DATE_LOGGED:10 March 2020 DATA_RESOLVED: Unresolved.
When there is an empty cel value inside wxGrid, text can be overwritten to the cell on the right.
I think this is a wxWidgets bug. The way I get around it is by adding a " " space into the cell.
This needs to be accounted for if your using the String IsEmpty(), might need to trim white space.
I created a Utility::IsEmpty(wxString str) function to remove this white space.v

If a field definition is marked as NOT NULL, then prompt the user to enter in the field before they hit OK.
Also put an * after the Title name to show that the field is required.
